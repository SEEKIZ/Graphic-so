### How It Works ‚úÖ

graphic.so leverages a chat interface and input triggers to initiate workflows that integrate seamlessly with other applications like Discord, Slack, and Notion.
When a specified input is received or a chat interaction occurs,
graphic.so activates the designated actions in the connected services to facilitate real-time responses and automate tasks efficiently. Additionally, it employs advanced AI models such as Flux, LumaLabs, and Stable Diffusion to generate generative images and videos, automating creative processes across various media applications.

### Setting Up Your First Workflow ‚≠ï

1. **Define the Trigger**:
   Configure Google Drive as the trigger. Specify the events within Google Drive that should start the workflow.

2. **Configure the Actions**:
   Choose and set up the actions that should be executed in Discord, Slack, or Notion once the trigger event occurs.

3. **Test and Deploy**:
   Test the workflow thoroughly to ensure that it functions as intended. Once confirmed, deploy it to automate your tasks without further manual intervention.
